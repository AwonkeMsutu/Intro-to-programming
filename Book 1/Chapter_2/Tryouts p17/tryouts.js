// Variable initialization:
// Creating a variable named 'balloons' and storing the number 15
var balloons = 15; 

// Creating a second variable named 'moreballoons' and storing the number 9
var moreballoons = 9; 

// Note: In a browser console, the line above returns 'undefined' 
// simply because assigning a value to a variable doesn't have a "result" to show.
undefined

// Mathematical Expression:
// Step 1: Parentheses () force the addition to happen first (15 + 9 = 24)
// Step 2: The result (24) is then multiplied by 2
(balloons + moreballoons) * 2;

// The console outputs 48, which is the final calculated value.
48
