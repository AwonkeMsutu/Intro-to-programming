        <p>You are a deep-sea diver known as "The Iron Lung." While repairing your submarine, The Rusty Anchor, you receive a ping on your sonar: "Iron Lung,<p>
             <p>we've located the S.S. Glimmer. It sank with a chest of golden artifacts, but a massive storm is moving in. We need you to dive now before the silt</p> 
            <p>covers it forever." You were supposed to attend your best friend's birthday party tonight, but this haul could pay off your ship's debt.
              What do you do? Dive for gold or go to the party?</p>

    <p>Fortune favors the bold! You plunge into the dark, icy water. The descent is silent and beautiful.</p>
    <p>After forty minutes of searching the murky floor, you find the S.S. Glimmer. It’s beautiful, but as you approach the hull, you feel a tug on your oxygen line.</p>
    <p>You look back and see a giant octopus has tangled itself in your air hose. It isn't attacking, but its weight is crimping the tube. You're losing air fast.</p>
    <p>You have a choice: try to stay calm and untangle the hose, or cut the heavy treasure chest loose to swim to the surface faster. What will you do?</p>
</div>

<div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
    <p>You decide to go to the party. The pizza is great, and your friend is happy you showed up.</p>
    <p>However, the next morning you read the news: someone else found the S.S. Glimmer and is now a billionaire. At least you got a goody bag and some pepperoni pizza!</p>
</div>

<div class="storyPart" id="err1">
    <p>Please answer Stay Calm or Swim Up.</p>
</div>

<div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
    <p>You decide to stay calm and work the hose free. It's a gamble, but your steady hands prevail! The octopus swims away, and you manage to haul the chest into your sub just as your oxygen tank hits zero.</p>
    <p>Inside the chest, you don't just find gold; you find an ancient map to an even bigger city of pearls! You're not just rich; you're a legend.</p>
</div>

<div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
    <p>You drop the chest and kick for the surface. You make it up safely, but you're empty-handed.</p>
    <p>When you get back to the docks, your boss tells you that the octopus was a trained guard. He only tangles the hose to test a diver's courage. If you had stayed, he would have helped you carry the gold.</p>
    <p>He fires you for being a coward. You start walking home, soaking wet and broke.</p>

    <p>The end of the journey. Refresh to try again!</p>
